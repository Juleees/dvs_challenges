# Data Vis Society Challenges

Every month the DVS releases challenges for the community using all sort of datasets. 

Here is a repository of all the challenges I participated in:

## August Challenge
This Challenge is focused on the results of the Annual Data Visualization Community Survey!

### Data
The Annual Data Visualization Community Survey for 2019 has responses to 50+ questions and was taken by over 1,350 people. It covers professional data visualization details like salary and hourly compensation, tool use, location, demographic data, audiences, organizational structure and more. Naturally, we want to visualize it!
